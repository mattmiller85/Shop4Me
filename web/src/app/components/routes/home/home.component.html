    <p class="desc">Shop4Me is a website that will allow you to create custom searches for various hard-to-find items.

Searches can be done live, or they can be saved and scheduled to run at a time you specify. If you do not instantly get a result, you can save that search, schedule it to run, and be notified once your search hits a result.</p>

    <p>All you need to do is create an account, login, and begin searching, and Shop4Me will do the rest!</p>
